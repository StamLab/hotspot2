BEDOPS enabled Hotspot.
The software is a fast implementation of the hotspot algorithm for identifying regions of enrichment
in next generation sequencing assays.

### Requirements ###

* BEDOPS >2.4
* Python 2.7

### Running ###

The software is modular. As such, various tasks will utlize somewhat different scripts.
Adding cheap parallelization should be very straightfoward.

See the "runall" script in the root folder to see examples of how to run the software.

### TODO ###

* Badspot implementation
